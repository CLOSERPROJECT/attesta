* DONE [#A] Lock scope and compatibility contract
Effort: S
Goal: Freeze functional scope and avoid accidental breaking behavior while introducing workflow selection.
Notes: Decision resolved in favor of minimal change with explicit workflow-scoped routes and compatibility redirects for old deep links.
** DONE [#A] Define final behavior and non-breaking defaults
Why: The app currently assumes one workflow in memory and global routes; multi-workflow needs deterministic selection and URL scoping.
Change: Adopt this contract: (1) `GET /` and `GET /backoffice` become workflow pickers; (2) selected workflow redirects to workflow-scoped pages; (3) legacy read routes (`/process/:id`, `/backoffice/:role/process/:id`) issue `303` redirects to the matching workflow-scoped route when resolvable; (4) legacy mutating routes without workflow context return `400`.
Tests: Add route-level tests asserting redirect and `400` behavior for legacy endpoints.
Done when: Compatibility policy is codified in handler tests and no unresolved route ambiguity remains.

* DONE [#A] Introduce workflow catalog loading from `server/config`
Effort: M
Goal: Load, validate, and cache multiple workflow YAML files from one directory.
Notes: Keep dependencies unchanged; use standard library + existing YAML package.
** DONE [#A] Replace single config path with catalog provider
Why: `Server.configPath` + `getConfig()` only supports one file and one cached config.
Change: In `server/cmd/server/main.go`, replace single-config fields with catalog fields (directory path, per-file modtimes, parsed catalog cache). Add `workflowCatalog()` and `workflowByKey(key)` helpers. Discover files from `config/*.yaml`; derive `workflowKey` from filename (basename without extension); validate uniqueness and non-empty `workflow.name` and `steps`.
Tests: Update `server/cmd/server/config_test.go` to cover multi-file discovery, invalid file rejection, duplicate key handling, and cache invalidation when one file changes.
Done when: Server can list >1 workflow config from `server/config` and return one by key with stable caching.
** DONE [#B] Define catalog DTOs for templates and handlers
Why: Home/backoffice pickers need a shared, explicit view model.
Change: Add lightweight DTOs in `server/cmd/server/main.go` (or nearby): `WorkflowOption{Key, Name}`, `WorkflowPickerView{PageBase, Workflows}`; keep REPR style by creating distinct view structs per page (`HomeWorkflowPickerView`, `BackofficeWorkflowPickerView`) even if same fields initially.
Tests: Handler tests assert picker pages render workflow name + link target per key.
Done when: Picker handlers use typed DTOs and templates compile without reflection-based assumptions.

* DONE [#A] Make routes workflow-scoped (home and backoffice)
Effort: L
Goal: Ensure every business page and action executes under a selected workflow context.
Notes: Prefer explicit path scope over hidden cookie scope to reduce cross-flow mistakes.
** DONE [#A] Add workflow-scoped route tree
Why: Current routes (`/process/*`, `/backoffice/*`) cannot disambiguate workflow context.
Change: In `server/cmd/server/main.go`, add route parser for `/w/{workflowKey}/...` and dispatch to existing handlers with `workflowKey` parameter. Target endpoints: `/w/{key}/`, `/w/{key}/process/start`, `/w/{key}/process/{id}`, `/w/{key}/process/{id}/timeline`, `/w/{key}/process/{id}/substep/{substepId}/complete`, `/w/{key}/process/{id}/substep/{substepId}/file`, `/w/{key}/backoffice`, `/w/{key}/backoffice/{role}`, `/w/{key}/backoffice/{role}/partial`, `/w/{key}/backoffice/{role}/process/{id}`, `/w/{key}/impersonate`, `/w/{key}/events`.
Tests: Add/update `server/cmd/server/process_routes_test.go`, `server/cmd/server/backoffice_handler_test.go`, and `server/cmd/server/home_handler_test.go` for scoped routing and not-found behavior on unknown workflow key.
Done when: All UI links/actions resolve to `/w/{key}/...` and unknown keys consistently return `404`.
** DONE [#A] Render workflow pickers for home and backoffice entrypoints
Why: User requirement asks for first page listing all workflows for both user and backoffice surfaces.
Change: Update `server/templates/home.html` and `server/templates/backoffice.html` (or new picker templates) so `/` and `/backoffice` list workflows and link to `/w/{key}/` and `/w/{key}/backoffice`. Keep existing old landing content under workflow-scoped pages.
Tests: Template/handler tests assert workflow list appears on both pickers; selected link lands on current existing landing behavior.
Done when: Entry pages show all configured workflows and clicking one opens the prior landing UX within that workflow.

* DONE [#A] Persist workflow identity on processes and enforce app-level isolation
Effort: L
Goal: Ensure process reads/writes are strictly scoped to the workflow they belong to.
Notes: This is the core guardrail before Cerbos, and prevents cross-flow data leakage.
** DONE [#A] Add `WorkflowKey` to process model and store filters
Why: Existing `workflowDefID` is server-generated once and does not identify per-file workflow context.
Change: In `server/cmd/server/main.go` and `server/cmd/server/store.go`, add `Process.WorkflowKey string` (BSON `workflowKey`). On process creation, set from selected workflow key. Replace global list/latest methods with scoped variants in `Store` (`LoadLatestProcessByWorkflow`, `ListRecentProcessesByWorkflow`) and apply Mongo filters `{workflowKey: key}` plus matching in `MemoryStore`.
Tests: Update `server/cmd/server/store_test.go` and `server/cmd/server/store_mongo_crud_test.go` to validate list/latest isolation by workflow key.
Done when: Home/dashboard/history for workflow A never include process data from workflow B.
** DONE [#A] Enforce workflow/process match in every handler
Why: A user can guess process IDs; handlers must reject cross-workflow process access.
Change: For all process-based handlers in `server/cmd/server/main.go`, after `loadProcess`, verify `process.WorkflowKey == selectedWorkflowKey`; on mismatch return `404` (not `403`) to avoid workflow enumeration. Apply this to timeline, exports, completion, file download, and backoffice process pages.
Tests: Extend `server/cmd/server/process_read_handler_test.go`, `server/cmd/server/download_handler_test.go`, and `server/cmd/server/complete_handler_test.go` with mismatch cases expecting `404`.
Done when: Any attempt to use workflow A route with workflow B process ID returns `404` across all endpoints.

* DONE [#A] Extend Cerbos contract to include workflow scope
Effort: M
Goal: Prevent authorization decisions from allowing cross-workflow completions.
Notes: Keep policy simple: same role + sequence checks, plus workflow match.
** DONE [#A] Include workflow attributes in check request and policy
Why: Current Cerbos attrs only include role/sequence/process/substep and cannot distinguish flows.
Change: Update `server/cmd/server/authorizer.go` interface + implementation to pass `workflowKey` and include `request.resource.attr.workflowKey`; include `request.principal.attr.workflowKey` in principal payload. Update `cerbos/policies/substep_policy.yaml` condition with equality check between principal and resource workflow keys.
Tests: Update `server/cmd/server/authorizer_test.go` to assert both attrs are sent; add deny-case test for mismatched workflow attrs.
Done when: Cerbos allows only when role, sequence, and workflow key all match.
** DONE [#B] Scope impersonation identity by workflow
Why: Current cookie `demo_user=user|role` is global and can bleed between workflows.
Change: In `server/cmd/server/main.go`, extend actor model/cookie parsing to include workflow key (`user|role|workflowKey`) for workflow-scoped routes. Keep backward parser for old 2-part cookie, defaulting workflow to route key at read time.
Tests: Update `server/cmd/server/helpers_request_test.go` and `server/cmd/server/impersonate_handler_test.go` for 3-part cookie format and backward compatibility.
Done when: Completing actions in workflow A with a workflow B impersonation cookie is denied before mutation.

* DONE [#B] Scope SSE channels and frontend refresh calls by workflow
Effort: M
Goal: Stop cross-workflow dashboard/timeline refreshes and keep live updates accurate.
Notes: Minimal frontend change in existing `web/src/main.js`.
** DONE [#B] Add workflow key to SSE subscriptions and refresh URLs
Why: Current SSE channels for roles are global (`role:{role}`), causing cross-flow updates.
Change: Update `server/cmd/server/main.go` event endpoint to accept `workflow` query and subscribe to namespaced channels (`process:{workflow}:{id}`, `role:{workflow}:{role}`). Update broadcasts after completion/start accordingly. In `web/src/main.js`, derive `workflowKey` from page dataset and call scoped URLs for `EventSource` and `fetch`.
Tests: Update `server/cmd/server/events_handler_test.go`; add/adjust JS tests if present, otherwise handler + template dataset coverage in Go tests.
Done when: Dashboard/timeline in one workflow no longer refresh from events emitted by other workflows.

* DONE [#A] Update templates and page base contracts
Effort: M
Goal: Ensure all links/forms/nav remain in selected workflow context.
Notes: Keep UX unchanged after selection except URL prefix.
** DONE [#A] Add workflow context to page base and templates
Why: Hardcoded links currently point to global routes (`/process/...`, `/backoffice/...`).
Change: Extend `PageBase` with `WorkflowKey` (and optionally `WorkflowName`) in `server/cmd/server/main.go`. Update templates: `server/templates/layout.html`, `server/templates/process.html`, `server/templates/backoffice_department.html`, `server/templates/backoffice_process.html`, `server/templates/action_list.html`, and `server/templates/home.html`/`server/templates/backoffice.html` picker variants to generate scoped links and form actions.
Tests: Existing handler template tests (`home_handler_test.go`, `backoffice_handler_test.go`, `process_read_handler_test.go`) updated to assert scoped paths.
Done when: No rendered link/form action points to unscoped business routes.

* DONE [#A] Complete verification and rollout/migration
Effort: S
Goal: Ship safely with deterministic migration behavior for existing processes.
Notes: Existing DB records without `workflowKey` must not break runtime.
** DONE [#A] Migration and fallback strategy
Why: Existing processes likely miss `workflowKey`; strict filtering would hide them.
Change: Add one-time compatibility fallback in store query layer: for configured default workflow key, include records where `workflowKey` is missing; on first successful write to such process, persist inferred key. Document this in `README.md` or `QUICKSTART.md`.
Tests: Add store tests for missing `workflowKey` fallback and write-back behavior.
Done when: Pre-existing data is visible in default workflow, and newly created/updated records always contain `workflowKey`.
** DONE [#A] Full regression run and acceptance checklist
Why: Multi-workflow touches routing, auth, persistence, templates, and SSE.
Change: Run `cd server && go test ./...` and targeted integration checks (`go test -tags=integration ./...` when dependencies are up). Validate manual acceptance: pick workflow on `/` and `/backoffice`, create process, complete substep, ensure other workflow cannot read/mutate same process, and Cerbos denies workflow mismatch.
Tests: Unit + integration + manual smoke checklist.
Done when: All tests pass and acceptance checklist is green with at least two workflow YAML files in `server/config`.

* WIP [#A] Fix backoffice landing workflow picker regression
Effort: S
Goal: Ensure `/backoffice` reliably offers workflow selection and validates isolation with distinct users per workflow.
Notes: This is a corrective slice after the initial multi-workflow rollout; no new dependencies and no route contract changes.
** DONE [#A] Re-enable or correct workflow choices on `/backoffice`
Why: The current behavior is reported broken; operators must be able to choose the target workflow from the backoffice landing before role/process navigation.
Change: In `server/cmd/server/main.go` and `server/templates/backoffice.html`, enforce that `GET /backoffice` always renders a workflow picker sourced from catalog DTOs (same source as `/`). Verify links target `/w/{key}/backoffice` for each configured workflow and never auto-select implicitly.
Tests: Extend `server/cmd/server/backoffice_handler_test.go` with a failing-first case for `/backoffice` rendering all configured workflows and correct scoped hrefs.
Done when: Visiting `/backoffice` with at least two workflow YAML files always shows both choices and navigates into the selected scoped backoffice landing.
** WIP [#A] Use distinct user sets per workflow for end-to-end validation
Why: Reusing the same impersonated users across workflows can hide scope leaks in cookie/session and Cerbos checks.
Change: In `server/config/workflow*.yaml`, assign non-overlapping demo users per workflow (unique `userId` values per role per workflow). Validate impersonation flow uses workflow-bound identities and denies cross-workflow cookie reuse.
Tests: Add/adjust handler tests in `server/cmd/server/impersonate_handler_test.go` and `server/cmd/server/complete_handler_test.go` to assert workflow A user cannot complete workflow B route/process, plus manual smoke checks from `/backoffice` picker.
Done when: Each workflow is operated by its own user set, impersonation remains functional per workflow, and cross-workflow action attempts are denied consistently.
